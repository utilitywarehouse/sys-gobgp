[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/utilitywarehouse/sys-gobgp/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/utilitywarehouse/sys-gobgp)

This repo simply builds images that contain pinned versions of
[GoBGP](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp) executables.

The purpose is to have control over versions and updates as opposed to `gobgp`
repo where only the `latest` image is build and available.
